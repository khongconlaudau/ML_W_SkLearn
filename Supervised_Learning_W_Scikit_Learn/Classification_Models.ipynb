    "### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "- In the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm k is just a number that tells the algorithm how many nearby points or neighbors to look at when it makes a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: Imagine you're deciding which fruit it is based on its shape and size. You compare it to fruits you already know.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If k = 3, the algorithm looks at the 3 closest fruits to the new one.\n",
    "    - If 2 of those 3 fruits are apples and 1 is a banana, the algorithm says the new fruit is an apple because most of its neighbors are apples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to choose the value of k for KNN Algorithm?\n",
    "    - The value of k in KNN decides how many neighbors the algorithm looks at when making a prediction.\n",
    "    - Choosing the right k is important for good results.\n",
    "    - If the data has lots of noise or outliers, using a larger k can make the predictions more stable.\n",
    "    - But if k is too large the model may become too simple and miss important patterns and this is called underfitting.\n",
    "    - So k should be picked carefully based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical Methods for Selecting k\n",
    "    - Cross-Validation: Cross-Validation is a good way to find the best value of k is by using k-fold cross-validation. This means dividing the dataset into k parts. The model is trained on some of these parts and tested on the remaining ones. This process is repeated for each part. The k value that gives the highest average accuracy during these tests is usually the best one to use.\n",
    "    - Elbow Method: In Elbow Method we draw a graph showing the error rate or accuracy for different k values. As k increases the error usually drops at first. But after a certain point error stops decreasing quickly. The point where the curve changes direction and looks like an \"elbow\" is usually the best choice for k.\n",
    "Odd Values for k: It’s a good idea to use an odd number for k especially in classification problems. This helps avoid ties when deciding which class is the most common among the neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - No Training Period: KNN is a lazy learner, meaning it does not require a training phase, which makes it fast to implement.\n",
    "    - Flexibility: It can handle multi-class classification problems and is easy to understand and implement.\n",
    "    - Adaptability: New data can be added seamlessly without retraining the model.\n",
    "- Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Computationally Intensive: KNN can be slow for large datasets as it requires computing the distance between the new point and all existing points.\n",
    "    - Sensitive to Noise and Outliers: KNN is sensitive to noisy data and outliers, which can affect its performance.\n",
    "    - Feature Scaling Required: It requires feature scaling to ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations"

    "    - Prone to Overfitting: Decision trees can easily overfit the training data, especially if they are deep and complex.\n",
